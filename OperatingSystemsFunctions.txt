One function of an operating system is file management. File management is keeping the files where it should be, and keeps track of every file you add or delete. It also keeps track if you have a file opened or closed so you don't make a mistake by deleting an open file on your computer.
Another function of an operating system is memory management. Memory management is used so that it tracks what applications is using what memory. It also allocates memory based on what needs more then another application or if the OS is doing something memory intensive.
